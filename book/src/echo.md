# A little cargonauts app

We're going to get to know cargonauts a bit better by creating a very small
application. This will be a very small and stateless "echo" service: when
you request a route like this:

```
GET /ping/$slug
```

It will return a response containing the slug you sent as well as a timestamp
for the current time.
