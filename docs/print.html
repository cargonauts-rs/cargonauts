<p>These docs are incomplete, but hopefully they will help you a little bit.</p>
<p>In addition to the book, here are other resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cargonauts-rs.github.io/cargonauts/api/cargonauts">API documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cargonauts-rs/cargonauts">GitHub repository</a></li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resources-methods-and-formats" id="resources-methods-and-formats"><h1>Resources, methods and formats</h1></a>
<p>cargonauts is a <strong>resource-oriented</strong> and <strong>RESTful</strong> framework. This means
that you will model the surface of your application in terms of resources
which have behaviors, rather than as &quot;remote procedural call&quot; (RPC) functions.</p>
<p>The three most important building blocks in cargonauts <strong>resources</strong>,
<strong>methods</strong>, and <strong>formats</strong>. Every endpoint in your application is constructed
by combining a resource, a method, and a format.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resources" id="resources"><h2>Resources</h2></a>
<p>Resources are the primary construct you'll be using to define your application.
A resource is a type which is used to collect the data yielded by a set of
endpoints. Every resource implements the <code>Resource</code> trait. A resource might
look like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct User {
    user_id: Uuid,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    is_admin: bool,
    joined_at: DateTime&lt;UTC&gt;,
    last_logged_in: DateTime&lt;UTC&gt;,
}


impl Resource for User {
    type Identifier = Uuid;
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#methods" id="methods"><h2>Methods</h2></a>
<p>Resources define <em>data</em>; but to create an endpoint you also need some
<em>behavior</em> - the code that will be executed when the endpoint is accessed. This
is where methods come in.</p>
<p>A method is a trait, defining a behavior that could be implemented by any
resource. To define an endpoint, you will need to implement a method for a
resource.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>Index</code> method controls the behavior of <code>GET /$resource-type</code>.
You can define what happens when that request is hit for the user type by
implementing Index for User:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl Index for User {
    fn index(env: Environment) -&gt; Box&lt;Future&lt;Item = Vec&lt;User&gt;, Error = Error&gt;&gt; {
        // Note: panicking is not actually a good choice; it will crash your
        // server.
        panic!(&quot;Not implemented yet&quot;)
    }
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#formats" id="formats"><h2>Formats</h2></a>
<p>The last piece of this picture is the format. While the resource has defined
the data and the method has defined the behavior, you have not yet specified
how that data will be presented in terms of HTTP.</p>
<p>Formats specify presentation in a manner which is abstract over different
resources and methods, so that you can reuse that logic again and again. You
don't have to write code to bind your resource or method to a particular format</p>
<ul>
<li>instead, you will declare the format to use for each method in the <code>routes!</code>
DSL.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#relationship-to-mvc" id="relationship-to-mvc"><h2>Relationship to MVC</h2></a>
<p>This tripartite division is essentially an application of the model, view,
controller pattern - it divides the work into data, logic, and presentation.
However, it is different from many MVC frameworks (like Ruby on Rails) because
it has more narrowly scoped the question.</p>
<p>In Rails, the model is responsible for persistence - in cargonauts, resources
do not necessarily correspond to any particular persistence form (that is, they
are not backed by a database table necessarily).</p>
<p>Similarly, in Rails the controller often encompasses both domain logic and HTTP
presentation logic. Here, the method and format clearly separate those two
responsibilities.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#beyond-mvc" id="beyond-mvc"><h2>Beyond MVC</h2></a>
<p>Resources, methods, and formats aren't the only building block that cargonauts
gives you. It also comes with an API for wrapping your endpoints in middleware,
and provides ways to handle interacting with other networked services in a
way which is designed to be highly decoupled.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a-little-cargonauts-app" id="a-little-cargonauts-app"><h1>A little cargonauts app</h1></a>
<p>We're going to get to know cargonauts a bit better by creating a very small
application. This will be a very small and stateless &quot;echo&quot; service: when
you request a route like this:</p>
<pre><code>GET /ping/$slug
</code></pre>
<p>It will return a response containing the slug you sent as well as a timestamp
for the current time.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setting-up-a-new-cargonauts-project" id="setting-up-a-new-cargonauts-project"><h1>Setting up a new cargonauts project</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#install-nightly-rust" id="install-nightly-rust"><h2>Install nightly Rust</h2></a>
<p>This guide assumes you have both Rust and cargo. Specifically, cargonauts
currently depends on the <strong>nightly</strong> version of Rust. You need to get the
nightly Rust compiler on your machine in order to use cargonauts.</p>
<p>If you don't have Rust yet, I recommend installing it using
<a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>, which will help you handle having multiple
versions of Rust installed at the same time. Once you've installed rustup,
you can get the nightly version of Rust with this command:</p>
<pre><code>rustup install nightly
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#install-cargonauts-cli" id="install-cargonauts-cli"><h2>Install <code>cargonauts-cli</code></h2></a>
<p>To quickly get started with cargonauts, you should install the <code>cargonauts-cli</code>
crate. This is just a tiny app which helps you generate the source code for
your app, it isn't involved in running it.</p>
<p>You can install the CLI with cargo:</p>
<pre><code>cargo install cargonauts-cli
</code></pre>
<p>This gives you a new command, <code>cargonauts</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#create-the-echo-project" id="create-the-echo-project"><h2>Create the echo project</h2></a>
<p>Now that we have the CLI, we'll use it to create our application, which we're
going to call &quot;echo&quot;. The command to create our app is this:</p>
<pre><code>cargonauts new echo
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new Rust application in the <code>echo</code> directory. Move into that
directory and make sure that you'll be using the nightly compiler with rustup:</p>
<pre><code>cd ./echo
rustup override set nightly
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#build-your-application" id="build-your-application"><h3>Build your application</h3></a>
<p>Now, to make sure that everything is in order, let's build the application with
<code>cargo build</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and despite our best intentions, building all of cargonauts'
dependencies for the first time will take several minutes. Feel free to treat
yourself to a refreshment, or do something you like to do, while your waiting
for all of our dependencies to build.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something to do, feel free to advance to the
<a href="./structure.md">next section</a> of this book, where we'll explore some of the
files that we've created so far. You can read through this section before your
app has finished building.</p>
<p>If your app doesn't build correctly, please visit the
<a href="https://gitter.im/cargonauts-rs/cargonauts">gitter channel</a> for help.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#structure-of-your-application" id="structure-of-your-application"><h1>Structure of your application</h1></a>
<p>If you look at the src directory you've created with <code>cargonauts new</code>, you'll
notice that it has created quite a few files for you. We're going to walk
through some of the most important ones now, and leave the rest of them for
later.</p>
<p>Here's the files and directories we'll be walking through in this section of
the book:</p>
<pre><code>src
├── bin
│   └── server.rs
├── lib.rs
├── resources
│   └── mod.rs
├── routing.rs
└── templates
</code></pre>
<p>(If you look at the source yourself, you'll see that there are some additional
modules, but we won't be looking at them just yet.)</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#srcbinserverrs" id="srcbinserverrs"><h3><code>src/bin/server.rs</code></h3></a>
<p>The application created by <code>cargonauts new</code> has a split library/binary
structure, like many Rust applications. The bulk of your application exists in
a library, but it is wrapped by a smaller binary that depends on it. This file
is the binary for your server.</p>
<p>The default server binary is very brief: it just runs your application using
<code>cargonauts::serve</code>. If you want to perform additional set up or tear down
around your application, you can do so by editing this file.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#srclibrs" id="srclibrs"><h3><code>src/lib.rs</code></h3></a>
<p>This is the root of your application. It is also fairly brief: it activates the
<code>associated_consts</code> feature flag, declares a dependency on cargonauts, lists
your top level modules, and contains one re-export.</p>
<p>The re-export is worth noticing: we re-export <code>routing::routes</code>; this is the
item created by the <code>routes!</code> macro, which is a high level description of your
application. The <code>routes</code> item is the &quot;entry-point&quot; to your application which
the server binary uses to serve it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#srcroutingrs" id="srcroutingrs"><h3><code>src/routing.rs</code></h3></a>
<p>This file contains the <code>routes!</code> macro. At the top, it imports many of the
things you'll need to make your <code>routes!</code> macro work as you add to it, and then
it contains an empty macro, waiting for you to add routes to your application.</p>
<p>The <code>routes!</code> macro is the magic that binds cargonauts together. The rest of
your application is normal Rust code: you define types and implement traits for
them. But the <code>routes!</code> macro has its own language, which takes a high level
description of all of your endpoints and constructs your application from it.</p>
<p>One important aspect of the <code>routes!</code> macro is that every <em>CamelCase</em> name
inside it is just a type that has been imported into this module. All of the
imports at the top of this file bring in types that you'll be using in
describing in your routes - mainly the names of resources, methods, and
formats.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-resources-module" id="the-resources-module"><h3>The resources module</h3></a>
<p>This is where you define your resources, and implement methods for them. This
is probably the module you'll turn to most often, at least at first.</p>
<p>In the next section, we're going to create a new resource and implement a
method for it, so we'll be editing code in this module quite a bit.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-templates-directory" id="the-templates-directory"><h3>The templates directory</h3></a>
<p>This directory is for your templates. When formatting your resources into HTTP
responses, the format has access to the templates you define here in order to
render the response. Some formats use templates and some do not.</p>
<p>Templates are located at <code>templates/$resource/$method</code>, for example, something
like: <code>templates/user/get.html.hbs</code> (all file extensions are optional).</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a submodule of your Rust application; you should not put
Rust code in this directory, just templates.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#running-your-application" id="running-your-application"><h2>Running your application</h2></a>
<p>As a final note about the structure of your application, you can run your
server any time with this command:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run server
</code></pre>
<p>By default, your server will serve on port <code>7878</code>. Right now it should be
an empty application, so any request to <code>localhost:7878</code> should return a 404,
file not found error.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-our-first-endpoint" id="creating-our-first-endpoint"><h1>Creating our first endpoint</h1></a>
<p>Now that our application is set up, its time to actually implement some
behavior. We're going to write the single endpoint we described earlier:</p>
<pre><code>GET /ping/$slug
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#committing" id="committing"><h3>Committing</h3></a>
<p>Before we get to that though, its a good idea to commit your repository so
that you can revert to it if things go bad. You'll also be able to use
<code>git diff</code> to view the changes you've made at each step of the documentation.</p>
<pre><code>git add --all
git commit -m &quot;An empty cargonauts app, ripe with potential.&quot;
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-our-resource" id="creating-our-resource"><h2>Creating our resource</h2></a>
<p>The first thing we need to create an endpoint is a resource. Because creating
resources is a very common thing to do, the cargonauts command has a subcommand
which will create a new resource for you. This command is aptly named
<code>generate resource</code>. Let's create a resource called ping:</p>
<pre><code>cargonauts generate resource ping
</code></pre>
<p>Feel free to use git to view the changes, the generator makes these three
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We add a new module to the resource module. This contains the beginnings of
the definition of our new resource.</li>
<li>We re-export that module from the top-level resource module.</li>
<li>We use that resource in the <code>routes!</code> macro.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's one important problem though: the definition of a resource generated
by the scaffolding is incomplete. For this reason, if you try to build your
application right now, you will get some errors.</p>
<p>We're going to fix that, but before we go any further, let's look at the
change to the routes! macro.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#changes-to-routingrs" id="changes-to-routingrs"><h3>Changes to <code>routing.rs</code></h3></a>
<p>Our <code>routes!</code> DSL now has its first declaration:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
routes! {
    resource Ping {
    }
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>routes!</code> DSL consists mostly of &quot;resource objects&quot; like this - there will
be one for each resource in your application, and it will contain various
additional items, mainly <code>method</code> statements, which we'll see in a bit.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#finishing-the-resource-impl" id="finishing-the-resource-impl"><h3>Finishing the Resource impl</h3></a>
<p>If you open <code>src/resources/ping.rs</code>, you'll see that it contains this impl:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl Resource for Ping {
    type Identifier = (); // TODO: Select the identifier type for this resource
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This impl contains an error: <code>()</code> is not a valid Identifier type. This is
because identifiers have to implement both <code>ToString</code> and <code>FromStr</code>, and <code>()</code>
does not.</p>
<p>The identifier type is parsed from the URL of the resource. When users request
<code>/ping/$slug</code>, it is <code>$slug</code> that is parsed into the identifier. If the slug
is not a valid string representation of that identifier type, users receive an
error response.</p>
<p>For our purposes, in which the slug can be anything, a <code>String</code> is a fine
representation of the slug, so let's make that change:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl Resource for Ping {
    type Identifier = String;
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-data-to-ping" id="adding-data-to-ping"><h3>Adding data to Ping</h3></a>
<p>We said earlier that the response from a ping request would have two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The slug requested</li>
<li>A timestamp</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Ping</code> type will be used to represent this data, so it needs to have a
field for each of these.</p>
<p>We've already decided that the slug is represented as a String. To represent
the timestamp, we can use the <code>chrono</code> crate.</p>
<p>Add a dependency on chrono (I used chrono version <code>0.3.1</code> while writing these
docs), and define your struct:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use chrono::{DateTime, UTC};

pub struct Ping {
    slug: String,
    timestamp: DateTime&lt;UTC&gt;,
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-a-method-to-ping" id="adding-a-method-to-ping"><h2>Adding a method to Ping</h2></a>
<p>Even though your app has a resource now, it <em>still</em> doesn't do anything! This
is because we haven't implemented any methods for that resource. A resource
without methods is like an object without methods, it doesn't actually do
anything.</p>
<p>We're going to make the <code>Ping</code> type implement the <code>Get</code> method. This is the
method that corresponds to <code>GET /$resource/$identiifer</code>, so its exactly what
we need to implement what we said.</p>
<p>We don't have a generator for this, so we'll do it all by hand.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-the-impl" id="adding-the-impl"><h3>Adding the impl</h3></a>
<p>The <code>Get</code> trait can be found in <code>cargonauts::methods</code>; we need to import it
and implement it for <code>Ping</code>. We also need to import from the futures crate
(which cargonauts re-exports), so that we can create a future. We'll start by
making our endpoint panic:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use cargonauts::methods::Get;
use cargonauts::futures::*;

impl Get for Ping {
    fn get(slug: String, _: Environment) -&gt; Box&lt;Future&lt;Item = Ping, Error = Error&gt;&gt; {
        panic!()
    }
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Creating our resource doesn't involve any IO or complex method calls; all we
need to do is construct our resource and wrap <code>future::ok().boxed()</code> around it,
like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
future::ok(Ping {
    slug: slug,
    timestamp: UTC::now(),
}).boxed()

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>That's it! Ping implements Get.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#deciding-what-format-to-use" id="deciding-what-format-to-use"><h3>Deciding what format to use</h3></a>
<p>The other thing we need to do before our endpoint is complete is to decide
which format we will use to display this method. cargonauts comes with three
formats out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debug:</strong> This format prints your type into the response using the <code>Debug</code>
trait from the standard library. As its name implies, its intended for
debugging, not as much for production code.</li>
<li><strong>JsonApi:</strong> An implementation of the <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON API</a> spec,
this provides a JSON exchange format for machine consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Handlebars:</strong> This renders your response from a template using the
handlebars templating language; this is intended for server side rendering of
HTML.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our purposes, we're going to use <code>Debug</code>, because its the easiest to use
for examples like this. Each format will have its own additional requirements
for resources to be formatted with it. In the case of <code>Debug</code>, the resource
type needs to implement the <code>Debug</code> trait from the standard library.</p>
<p>We can achieve that by deriving <code>Debug</code> for <code>Ping</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Ping {
    slug: String,
    timestamp: DateTime&lt;UTC&gt;,
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-the-method-to-the-routes-macro" id="adding-the-method-to-the-routes-macro"><h3>Adding the method to the <code>routes!</code> macro</h3></a>
<p>Though Ping implements Get, the endpoint still doesn't exist. The last thing
you need to do is declare your method in the routes! DSL. This check keeps all
of your routes in one place, so you don't have to trace impls all over your
code to figure out what routes your application has.</p>
<p>The syntax for creating a new route is like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
resource Ping {
    method Get in Debug;
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Every method you add to a resource will look like the same, a method name and
a format the method is to be displayed in. Like the resource, these are just
types that need to be in scope.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-routes-dsl-reference" id="the-routes-dsl-reference"><h1>The routes! DSL Reference</h1></a>
<p>Resources, methods, and formats are just normal Rust code, but they are brought
together in the <code>routes!</code> macro, which implements a complicated domain specific
language for assembling your application in a declarative way.</p>
<p>Just implementing a method for a resource isn't enough to create an endpoint;
it also needs to be added to your <code>routes!</code> macro, which looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use cargonauts::methods::Get;
use cargonauts::formats::JsonApi;

use resources::User;

routes! {
    resource User {
        method Get in JsonApi;
    }

<p>Having implemented Get for User (as well as the traits required to format a
User with JsonApi), this will create an endpoint for <code>GET /user/$id</code>. If you
haven't implemented all of the necessary traits, you will get a compiler error.</p>
<p>Every CamelCase name in the <code>routes!</code> macro is just a type imported into this
scope; there's no magic lookup for User, Get, or JsonApi, you have to have
imported them into this module in order to use them in the DSL.</p>
<p>The rest of this page will document the syntax for the <code>routes!</code> DSL.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resource-blocks" id="resource-blocks"><h3>Resource blocks</h3></a>
<p>A resource block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>resource $TYPE {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The $TYPE must implement the Resource trait.</p>
<p>By default, resources will be mounted at the kebab case form of the type
name - that is, all lowercase, joined by hyphens. For example, <code>User</code> will
be mounted at <code>user</code>, whereas a resource called <code>HappyDoggo</code> would be mounted
at <code>happy-doggo</code>.</p>
<p>If you don't like that route choice, you can use an <code>as</code> clause to rename it.
This takes a string literal. For example, you might prefer plural route names;
cargonauts will not automatically inflect your names for you, you'll have to
specify them:</p>
<pre><code>resource Person as &quot;people&quot; {
    ...
}

resource Cat as &quot;cats&quot; {

}


resource Doggo as &quot;puppers&quot; {

}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#method-statements" id="method-statements"><h3>Method statements</h3></a>
<p>Within a resource block, you can declare the methods that resource supports.
A method takes the syntax:</p>
<pre><code>method $METHOD in $FORMAT;
</code></pre>
<p>Where $METHOD is a method trait, and $FORMAT is a type which implements Format.</p>
<p>You can have multiple methods using the same format on the same line, separated
with commas, or not:</p>
<pre><code>method Get, Index, Post in JsonApi;
method Patch in Handlebars;
method Delete in Handlebars;
</code></pre>
<p>Currently each method can only be provided in one format, someday this will
change to support dispatching to different formats based on the Accepts
headers.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#relationship-blocks" id="relationship-blocks"><h3>Relationship blocks</h3></a>
<p>Resources can also contain relationships, which can be either <code>has one</code> or
<code>has many</code>:</p>
<pre><code>resource BlogPost {
    has one Author {
        ... 
    }

    has many Comment {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The type of a relationship block must implement Relationship. Like resource
blocks, these support aliases with <code>as</code>, and they can contain method
statements. Their method statements must be relationship methods:</p>
<pre><code>resource BlogPost {
    has many Comment as &quot;comments&quot; {
        method GetMany in JsonApi;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#modules" id="modules"><h3>Modules</h3></a>
<p>Resources can be put into inline modules; modules use the same syntax as in
regular Rust, and can be nested:</p>
<pre><code>mod api {
    mod foo_bar {
        resource Baz {
            ...
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>These will create directories in the API; for example, Baz's endpoints would
be mounted at <code>api/foo-bar/baz</code>. Note that modules, like types, are kebab
cased in the actual API.</p>
<p>These are only used to control the shape of the API; there is no namespacing
or use statements inside the <code>routes!</code> DSL.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setup-block" id="setup-block"><h3>Setup block</h3></a>
<p>The <code>routes!</code> DSL can also begin with a <code>setup</code> block. This block is used to
set up connections to other services when the application starts.</p>
<p>The setup block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>setup {
    connection to $SERVICE;
}
</code></pre>
<p>$SERVICE must be a type which implements NewService and Configure. Connections
to this service will be managed by a connection pool which you can configure
with your Cargo.toml.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#asset-handler" id="asset-handler"><h3>Asset handler</h3></a>
<p>By default, assets will be presented with a very simple asset handler,
providing few headers or other processing. If you wish to perform more complex
handling for your assets, you can define an asset hnadler function. This
function must have the signature:</p>
<pre><code>fn(path: &amp;'static Path, asset: &amp;'static [u8], req: middleware::Request) -&gt; middleware::http::BoxFuture
</code></pre>
<p>You can tell cargonauts to use this handler instead of the default with this
statement at the beginning of the <code>routes!</code> DSL:</p>
<pre><code>use $ASSET_HANDLER for assets;
</code></pre>
