<p>These docs are incomplete, but hopefully they will help you some.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#starting-a-new-cargonauts-app" id="starting-a-new-cargonauts-app"><h1>Starting a new cargonauts app</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#install-rust" id="install-rust"><h2>Install Rust</h2></a>
<p>This guide assumes that you have both Rust and cargo installed on your
computer. I recommend using <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>, which makes it
very easy to manage multiple installations of Rust.</p>
<p>cargonauts currently requires the <strong>nightly</strong> version of Rust. If you don't
have that installed, you can use rustup to install it:</p>
<pre><code>rustup install nightly
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#install-cargonauts-cli" id="install-cargonauts-cli"><h2>Install <code>cargonauts-cli</code></h2></a>
<p>To quickly get started with cargonauts, you should install the <code>cargonauts-cli</code>
crate. This is just a tiny app which helps you create a cargonauts app with
your source directory set up correctly.</p>
<p>You can install it with cargo:</p>
<pre><code>cargo install cargonauts-cli
</code></pre>
<p>This gives you a new command, <code>cargonauts</code>, which currently only has one
subcommand, which we'll be using in a second to create your app.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#create-your-project" id="create-your-project"><h2>Create your project</h2></a>
<p>To create your project, just run this command (where <code>&lt;my-app&gt;</code> is the name of
your app):</p>
<pre><code>cargonauts new &lt;my-app&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will initiate an app in a directory with the same name, which will have
a source directory set up to make cargonauts easy to use.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#build-your-dependencies" id="build-your-dependencies"><h2>Build your dependencies</h2></a>
<p>Now, you should build all the dependencies of cargonauts. Unfortunately, this
takes quite a while right now.</p>
<p>First, make sure you are using the nightly compiler:</p>
<pre><code>rustup override set nightly
</code></pre>
<p>Then, do a fresh build of your cargonauts dependency:</p>
<pre><code>cargo build -p cargonauts
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#running-your-application" id="running-your-application"><h2>Running your application</h2></a>
<p>You're all set. If you want to run your application, you can do so with this
command:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run server
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#structure-of-your-application" id="structure-of-your-application"><h1>Structure of your application</h1></a>
<p>If you've just created your application with <code>cargonauts new</code>, you may notice
that it created a lot of files for you. We'll walk through what each module
in your application is intended to be used for.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#binserverrs" id="binserverrs"><h3><code>bin/server.rs</code></h3></a>
<p>This is the server that you're going to be building, running, and deploying.
Your main application is a library, and this is a binary that depends on it.
Right now it just servers your application, but you can add any code you want
here to do additional setup and teardown aroud your running application.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#librs" id="librs"><h3><code>lib.rs</code></h3></a>
<p>This is the root of your application; it doesn't contain any code by default;
just extern crate and module declarations. It also re-exports the <code>routes</code> item
from your routing module; this is the public entrance to your entire
application.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#routingrs" id="routingrs"><h3><code>routing.rs</code></h3></a>
<p>The routing file contains the <code>routes!</code> macro, which is how we stitch all of
the code in your application together. You'll edit this whenever you want to
add new endpoints to your application.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-assets-directory" id="the-assets-directory"><h3>The assets directory</h3></a>
<p>This directory is for your static assets. By default, any assets here will be
built into your application at their path relative to the asset directory root.</p>
<p>Files starting with <code>index</code> will be served as the index for the directory they
are in, rather than at their filename.</p>
<p>This is not a submodule of your application; it does not contain Rust code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-clients-module" id="the-clients-module"><h3>The clients module</h3></a>
<p>This module is for defining clients, high level API wrappers around connections
to other running services.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-formats-module" id="the-formats-module"><h3>The formats module</h3></a>
<p>This module is for defining custom formats. cargonauts comes with several
useful formats out of the box, but if you need to define your own, you can do
so here.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-methods-module" id="the-methods-module"><h3>The methods module</h3></a>
<p>This module is for defining custom methods. cargonauts comes with many methods
covering most use case, but if you do need to define your own, this is the
module for them.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-middleware-module" id="the-middleware-module"><h3>The middleware module</h3></a>
<p>This is for defining middleware to wrap around your endpoint. If you need to
deal directly with the HTTP requests and responses in a way that doesn't
integrate into the resource/method/format structure of cargonauts, you just
need to write a middleware for that.</p>
<p>You can use middleware for instrumenting endpoints, for example.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-resources-module" id="the-resources-module"><h3>The resources module</h3></a>
<p>This is where you define your resources, and implement methods for them. This
is probably the module you'll turn to most often, at least at first.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-templates-directory" id="the-templates-directory"><h3>The templates directory</h3></a>
<p>This directory is for your templates. When formatting your resources into HTTP
responses, the format has access to the templates you define here in order to
render the response. Some formats use templates and some do not.</p>
<p>Templates are located at <code>templates/$resource/$method</code>, for example, something
like: <code>templates/user/get.html.hbs</code> (all file extensions are optional).</p>
<p>Like the assets directory, this is not a part of your application, and you
shouldn't put any Rust code here.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resources-methods-and-formats" id="resources-methods-and-formats"><h1>Resources, methods and formats</h1></a>
<p>The core concepts you need to understand to use cargonauts are <strong>resources</strong>,
<strong>methods</strong>, and <strong>formats</strong>. These are the building blocks for the &quot;front&quot; of
your application; by combining a resource, a method, and a route, you can
construct an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resources" id="resources"><h2>Resources</h2></a>
<p>cargonauts is REST-oriented web framework, so it is designed to enable you to
construct your application in terms of resources. Your application will have
many resources.</p>
<p>A resource is just a type that implements the <code>Resource</code> trait. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    joined_at: DateTime&lt;UTC&gt;,
}

impl Resource for User {
    type Identifier = Uuid;
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The Resource trait is very small: it just specifies the type of Identifier
used to uniquely identify each value of this resource.</p>
<p>You can think of the resource as defining the data that will be included in an
HTTP response to certain endpoints. Once you've defined a resource, you will
need to implement methods on it to give it behavior.</p>
<p>cargonauts doesnot provide any resources for you. You define all of the
resources that are appropriate to your domain.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#methods" id="methods"><h2>Methods</h2></a>
<p>Resources define data, whereas methods define behavior. All methods are traits,
and the file for a resource will contain not only that resource, but also
impl blocks for the methods implemented for it.</p>
<p>cargonauts comes with a large number of methods defined for you. You can see
the list of methods provided in the API docs.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl Get for User {
    fn get(id: Uuid, env: Environment) -&gt; Box&lt;Future&lt;Item = User, Error = Error&gt;&gt; {
        // ...
    }
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resource-and-collection-methods" id="resource-and-collection-methods"><h3>Resource and Collection methods</h3></a>
<p>Some methods are resource methods, whereas some are collection methods. That is
to say that some define HTTP endpoints on specific resources, whereas some
define them on the collection of all resources.</p>
<pre><code># This is a resource endpoint:
HTTP /&lt;resource-name&gt;/&lt;identifier&gt;

# This is a collection endpoint::
HTTP /&lt;resource-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For example, the <code>Get</code> method is a resource method, which defines what happens
when you <code>GET</code> a resource. On the other hand, the <code>Post</code> method is a collection
method, which deifnes what happens when you <code>POST</code> a collection endpoint.</p>
<p>Resource methods usually have an identifier as an argument, whereas collection
methods don't. The identifier is parsed from the route path.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#formats" id="formats"><h2>Formats</h2></a>
<p>Resources define data &amp; methods define behavior, but formats define
presentation. Once a method has been called on a resource, the format
translates that into an HTTP response.</p>
<p>Formats are types which implement the Format trait. A format likely will
require your resource to implement additional traits for it to work.</p>
<p>Cargonauts comes with three formats provided for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debug:</strong> This format is not intended for serious use; the Debug format
debug prints the data returned by a method into the response body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handlebars:</strong> This format is intended for server side rendering; it renders
templates using handlebars, and can receive POSTs from HTML forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JsonApi:</strong> This format is intended for creating APIs in JSON, and is an
implementation of the JSON API spec. It does not implement everything from that
spec yet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not directly hook your resources up to formats in the resource module;
instead, that is entirely handled as a part of the <code>routes!</code> macro.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-routes-dsl" id="the-routes-dsl"><h1>The routes! DSL</h1></a>
<p>Resources, methods, and formats are just normal Rust code, but they are brought
together in the <code>routes!</code> macro, which implements a complicated domain specific
language for assembling your application in a declarative way.</p>
<p>Just implementing a method for a resource isn't enough to create an endpoint;
it also needs to be added to your <code>routes!</code> macro, which looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use cargonauts::methods::Get;
use cargonauts::formats::JsonApi;

use resources::User;

routes! {
    resource User {
        method Get in JsonApi;
    }
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Having implemented Get for User (as well as the traits required to format a
User with JsonApi), this will create an endpoint for <code>GET /user/$id</code>. If you
haven't implemented all of the necessary traits, you will get a compiler error.</p>
<p>Every CamelCase name in the <code>routes!</code> macro is just a type imported into this
scope; there's no magic lookup for User, Get, or JsonApi, you have to have
imported them into this module in order to use them in the DSL.</p>
<p>The rest of this page will document the syntax for the <code>routes!</code> DSL.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resource-blocks" id="resource-blocks"><h3>Resource blocks</h3></a>
<p>A resource block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>resource $TYPE {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The $TYPE must implement the Resource trait.</p>
<p>By default, resources will be mounted at the kebab case form of the type
name - that is, all lowercase, joined by hyphens. For example, <code>User</code> will
be mounted at <code>user</code>, whereas a resource called <code>HappyDoggo</code> would be mounted
at <code>happy-doggo</code>.</p>
<p>If you don't like that route choice, you can use an <code>as</code> clause to rename it.
This takes a string literal. For example, you might prefer plural route names;
cargonauts will not automatically inflect your names for you, you'll have to
specify them:</p>
<pre><code>resource Person as &quot;people&quot; {
    ...
}

resource Cat as &quot;cats&quot; {

}


resource Doggo as &quot;puppers&quot; {

}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#method-statements" id="method-statements"><h3>Method statements</h3></a>
<p>Within a resource block, you can declare the methods that resource supports.
A method takes the syntax:</p>
<pre><code>method $METHOD in $FORMAT;
</code></pre>
<p>Where $METHOD is a method trait, and $FORMAT is a type which implements Format.</p>
<p>You can have multiple methods using the same format on the same line, separated
with commas, or not:</p>
<pre><code>method Get, Index, Post in JsonApi;
method Patch in Handlebars;
method Delete in Handlebars;
</code></pre>
<p>Currently each method can only be provided in one format, someday this will
change to support dispatching to different formats based on the Accepts
headers.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#relationship-blocks" id="relationship-blocks"><h3>Relationship blocks</h3></a>
<p>Resources can also contain relationships, which can be either <code>has one</code> or
<code>has many</code>:</p>
<pre><code>resource BlogPost {
    has one Author {
        ... 
    }

    has many Comment {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The type of a relationship block must implement Relationship. Like resource
blocks, these support aliases with <code>as</code>, and they can contain method
statements. Their method statements must be relationship methods:</p>
<pre><code>resource BlogPost {
    has many Comment as &quot;comments&quot; {
        method GetMany in JsonApi;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#modules" id="modules"><h3>Modules</h3></a>
<p>Resources can be put into inline modules; modules use the same syntax as in
regular Rust, and can be nested:</p>
<pre><code>mod api {
    mod foo_bar {
        resource Baz {
            ...
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>These will create directories in the API; for example, Baz's endpoints would
be mounted at <code>api/foo-bar/baz</code>. Note that modules, like types, are kebab
cased in the actual API.</p>
<p>These are only used to control the shape of the API; there is no namespacing
or use statements inside the <code>routes!</code> DSL.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setup-block" id="setup-block"><h3>Setup block</h3></a>
<p>The <code>routes!</code> DSL can also begin with a <code>setup</code> block. This block is used to
set up connections to other services when the application starts.</p>
<p>The setup block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>setup {
    connection to $SERVICE;
}
</code></pre>
<p>$SERVICE must be a type which implements NewService and Configure. Connections
to this service will be managed by a connection pool which you can configure
with your Cargo.toml.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#asset-handler" id="asset-handler"><h3>Asset handler</h3></a>
<p>By default, assets will be presented with a very simple asset handler,
providing few headers or other processing. If you wish to perform more complex
handling for your assets, you can define an asset hnadler function. This
function must have the signature:</p>
<pre><code>fn(path: &amp;'static Path, asset: &amp;'static [u8], req: middleware::Request) -&gt; middleware::http::BoxFuture
</code></pre>
<p>You can tell cargonauts to use this handler instead of the default with this
statement at the beginning of the <code>routes!</code> DSL:</p>
<pre><code>use $ASSET_HANDLER for assets;
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a-very-small-application" id="a-very-small-application"><h1>A very small application</h1></a>
<p>To bring the core concepts we've just introduced together, let's look at very
small, single-file application.</p>
<p>This application does one thing: it has an endpoint at <code>/echo/$STRING</code>, and
will respond to GET requests at that endpoint by Debug printing an Echo object
with that string into its body. Here's the code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">#![feature(associated_consts)]

#[macro_use] extern crate cargonauts;

use cargonauts::resources::{Resource, Environment, Error};
use cargonauts::methods::Get;
use cargonauts::formats::Debug;
use cargonauts::futures::{future, Future};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Echo {
    echo: String,
}

impl Resource for Echo {
    type Identifier = String;
}

impl Get for Echo {
    fn get(id: String, _: Environment) -&gt; Box&lt;Future&lt;Item = Echo, Error = Error&gt;&gt; {
        future::ok(Echo { echo: id }).boxed()
    }
}

routes! {
    resource Echo {
        method Get in Debug;
    }
}

fn main() {
    cargonauts::serve(routes).unwrap();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's walk through this section by section.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#top-matter" id="top-matter"><h3>Top matter</h3></a>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#![feature(associated_consts)]
#fn main() {

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>cargonauts depends on associated consts, which is why it is on nightly. When I
made this choice, I thought associated consts would be stable before I had
cargonauts ready to show people, but I was wrong.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[macro_use] extern crate cargonauts;

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We need to depend on cargonauts, and we have to apply macro_use to it or we
can't get the <code>routes!</code> macro.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use cargonauts::resources::{Resource, Environment, Error};
use cargonauts::methods::Get;
use cargonauts::formats::Debug;
use cargonauts::futures::{future, Future};

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>These are all the imports we need for this to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource is needed so Echo can implement it; Environment and Error appear in
any method impl.</li>
<li>Get is needed because its the method we'll be implemented.</li>
<li>Debug is needed because its the format we'll be using.</li>
<li>future and Future are used in our implementation of Get.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#resource-type" id="resource-type"><h3>Resource type</h3></a>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Echo {
    echo: String,
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is our resource type in this case. Its a simple type; it only has one
field.</p>
<p>Echo derives Debug because the Debug format requires that.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl Resource for Echo {
    type Identifier = String;
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Echo needs to implement Resource. Its Identifier in this case is a String (the
string we'll be echoing back).</p>
<pre><code>impl Get for Echo {
    fn get(id: String, _: Environment) -&gt; Box&lt;Future&lt;Item = Echo, Error = Error&gt;&gt; {
        future::ok(Echo { echo: id }).boxed()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is our single endpoint: we receive a string and then construct an Echo
from it to return. This can never fail and does no IO, but it needs to be
wrapped in a future because cargonauts is an async framework.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#routes-and-main" id="routes-and-main"><h3>Routes and main</h3></a>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
routes! {
    resource Echo {
        method Get in Debug;
    }
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The routes DSL here has only one resource and one method. This constructs our
actual app, hooking up the endpoint we defined. This macro ultimately expands
to an item named <code>routes</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    cargonauts::serve(routes).unwrap();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The main function serves our app uing the <code>serve</code> function from cargonauts,
which can take a <code>routes</code> object.</p>
